\section*{Master Thesis Research Idea}

\begin{center}
\textbf{Financial Constraints and Household Heterogeneity in the Macroeconomy}
\end{center}

My aim is to study the dynamic implications of a tightening of the household-level borrowing constraint in a macroeconomic model with heterogeneous agents (\Gls{ha}). My work follows and extends the analysis by \textcite{gl2017}, who consider a permanently tighter borrowing limit in a model without an aggregate state space. My extension would thus pertain to adding a medium-scale New Keynesian (\Gls{nk}) structure to their model. In doing so, I aim to include some form of aggregate financial frictions, potentially along the lines of the recent work by \textcite{zoch2022}.

Having obtained a full \Gls{hank} model, I will investigate the non-linear transition dynamics from an initial steady state to a state of permanently tighter credit and thus shed light on aggregate and household-level consequences of such a structural change.

\bigskip

The model and its dynamics will be solved using the Python package \texttt{Econpizza} by \textcite{boehl2023econpizza} and the methods therein.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Households face limits to borrowing. This almost trivial observation has a plethora of implications not only for households themselves but also for the aggregate economy.

\subsubsection*{Outline}
\label{sec:outline}
The remainder of this thesis is structured as follows. Section \ref{sec:literature} reviews the related literature. Section \ref{sec:model} lays down the macroeconomic model, the numerical implementation and calibration of which is discussed in section \ref{sec:implementation}. Thereafter, section \ref{sec:results} presents the results and section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

\section{Related Literature}
\label{sec:literature}

The work that is most closely related to the present one is \textcite{gl2017}. The authors, building on the working paper version \textcite{}, take a household-centered approach to study the transitional effects of an unexpected and permanent tightening in the household-level borrowing limit.
